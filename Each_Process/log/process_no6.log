VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV Installation of INTLAB VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV
 
This is the first call of INTLAB, and the best way to switch the 
rounding mode will be detected. It is a very rigorous check and takes
a short moment. This is done only once with the very first call of INTLAB.
 
To find the best routine, various routines are checked. 
Unfortunately, in very rare cases it might happen that a hard error
occurs. This should never happen, but it happens in some Matlab versions
and/or operating systems, and it is beyond my control. 
 
In such a rare case of a hard error, please restart INTLAB.
The circumstances will be stored, and this switching routine will not
be called again. Sorry for possible inconveniences. 
 
Press Enter to continue.>>
